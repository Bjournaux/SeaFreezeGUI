V0.9

SeaFreezeGUI is a graphic user interface for exploring the thermodynamic properties of water at extreme conditions based on the [SeaFreeze code](https://seafreeze.org).
The SeaFreeze package allows to compute the thermodynamic and elastic properties of water and ice polymorphs (Ih, II, III, V and VI) in the 0-2300 MPa and 220-500K range. It is based on the evaluation of Gibbs Local Basis Functions parametrization (https://github.com/jmichaelb/LocalBasisFunction) for each phase, constructed to reproduce thermodynamic measurments. The formalism is described in more details in [Journaux et al. (2020)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JE006176), and in the liquid water Gibbs parametrization by [Bollengier, Brown, and Shaw (2019)](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5097179). 

SeaFreeze GUI was develloped by Jack Rosenbloom, based on a previous implementation in Matlab by Erica Clinton, and under the advising of Prof. Baptiste Journaux at the University of Washington
